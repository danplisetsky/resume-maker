# resume-maker

A simple interactive resume-making tool. Live version is here: <https://danplisetsky.github.io/resume-maker/>

## How to use

- Edit text by double-clicking an element
- Change colors by clicking an element once and choosing the color at the right-hand corner
- Hover over elements for more options
- Create links from elements when you need it (for instance, if your blog is at `https://www.example.com/coolblog`, just enter `example.com/coolblog` and create a link)
  - Some links are smarter than others! For twitter, @coolhandle is enough, for github your profile name will suffice, and for email -- well, punch in your email address and click on the link icon!
- Check out the template resume to get an idea of what you can create!
- Save your resume:
  - Locally, by clicking on the Save Resume on Disk button and choosing where to save the file
  - Creating a shareable link, by clicking on the Generate Shareable Link button
  - In the browser, by clicking on the Save in Browser button
- Note that on mobile devices it's not meant to be used for editing, just for viewing
  - If you are editing your resume on a mobile device, please make sure to use landscape mode
